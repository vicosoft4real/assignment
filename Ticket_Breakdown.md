# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Ticket 1
###### Update Agent table to include custom id field:
Currently, Agents table only has the internal database id. We need to add a new field to the Agents table to store the custom id provided by Facilities. This new field will be a string data type with a maximum length of 50 characters.

###### Acceptance criteria:
A new field called "custom_id" is added to the Agents table, and it is visible in the database schema. The field can store up to 50 characters. The new field is included in the API and frontend of the platform.
###### Time/effort estimate: 
4 hours
###### Implementation details:
The database schema needs to be updated to include the new field. We also need to update the APIs that interact with the Agents table to handle the new field. Finally, we need to update the frontend to allow Facilities to input and edit the custom id for each Agent.


## Ticket 2
###### Update Shifts table to reference custom id: 
Currently, the Shifts table references Agents using their internal database id. We need to update it to reference the custom id instead.

###### Acceptance criteria: 
The Shifts table is updated to reference the custom_id field of the Agents table. The new foreign key relationship is visible in the database schema. The updated relationship is included in the API and frontend of the platform.
###### Time/effort estimate: 
2 hours
###### Implementation details: 
We need to update the database schema to include the new foreign key relationship. We also need to update the APIs that interact with the Shifts table to handle the new relationship. Finally, we need to update the frontend to display the custom id of the Agent on the Shifts page.

## Ticket 3
###### Update report generation function to use custom id: 
Currently, the report generation function uses the internal database id of the Agent to generate the report. We need to update it to use the custom id instead.

###### Acceptance criteria: 
The report generation function is updated to use the custom_id field of the Agents table instead of the internal database id. The custom id is included in the report generated by the function. The updated function is included in the API and frontend of the platform.
###### Time/effort estimate:
4 hours
###### Implementation details: 
We need to update the function to fetch the custom id of the Agent from the database instead of the internal database id. We also need to update the PDF generation library to include the custom id in the report.
